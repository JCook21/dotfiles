#Dotfiles

A collection of dotfiles.

## Installation

This project use [homesick] (https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick) to manage the dotfiles it contains. Once you've installed homesick add this repository using 'homesick clone'. To finish installation run:

`homesick rc dotfiles`

This will execute the .homesickrc file, which will add the solarized colour scheme, make the formatting of the 'ls' command also use solarized colors and install all of the Vim plugins using Vundle.
