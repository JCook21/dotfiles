#Dotfiles

A collection of dotfiles.

## Installation

This project use [homesick] (https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick) to manage the dotfiles it contains. Once you've installed homesick and add this repository as a castle installing the dotfiles is as simple as calling 'homesick symlink dotfiles'. You will also need to start vim and run ':BundleInstall' to install the plugins I use.
